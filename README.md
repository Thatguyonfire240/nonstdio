# nonstdio
a non-standard libary for integers in the C programming language

Hello and welcome to the nonStandardIO (nonstdio) library!
this library aims to give you a non standard system of using
integers in the great C language!! how it works is we shift
the value of each character to the left one unit, and you can
use the value of the character as an int!
